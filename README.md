## Introduction
----
Solutions for Advent of Code 2023. All of the problem statements and input are omitted here, but can be found on the website https://adventofcode.com/2023.

All of the solutions are written in Python, in somewhat overly-verbose and commented style. No external dependencies are used.

## Usage
----
To execute, head over to the appropriate directory, populate the input, then execute the python script in there:
```
cd day_X
cat > input
python3 prog.py
```

There should be some output. The execution time is usually < 1s, with a few exceptions for the more rough exercises. The solution for the day is usually the last line of output.
